# üöÄ ABAP ETL Template: From Bronze to Silver, a Journey Through Your Data!

Welcome to an innovative ABAP ETL template designed to revolutionize how you handle data within your S/4HANA landscape! This repository offers a clean, robust, and scalable framework built with the modern developer in mind, leveraging SOLID principles and Clean Code methodologies.

## üéñÔ∏è The Medallion Architecture: A Data Story
Imagine your data as a precious metal, progressively refined through distinct stages. That's the essence of the Medallion Architecture, a powerful concept borrowed from data lake strategies. Here, we break down your data journey into three key layers:
* **Bronze Layer (Raw & Unfiltered):** Your data's first stop ‚Äì raw, untouched, and in its original glory. Minimal processing, maximum preservation.
* **Silver Layer (Clean & Refined):** Time to polish! Here, Bronze data gets cleansed, transformed, and integrated, becoming consistent and ready for analysis.
* **Gold Layer (Curated & Ready-to-Use):** (Conceptual in this template!) The purest form of your data ‚Äì highly curated, aggregated, and optimized for consumption by BI tools, analytics, or services like Fiori apps.

### üåä The Architectural Flow: From Source to Silver
The ETL process starts with data landing in **Bronze layer tables** in S/4HANA, initiated by flexible methods like RFCs. Once there, "bronze\_lector" classes read this raw data, usually from dedicated CDS views.

The data then moves to the **Silver layer**, orchestrated by the [zetlcl_to_silver_orchestrator](/Src/Classes/zetlcl_to_silver_orchestrator.abap). This orchestrator calls individual "to\_silver" classes (e.g., [zetlcl_to_silver_xyz1](/Src/Classes/zetlcl_to_silver_xyz1.abap)), each responsible for transforming data from Bronze and saving it into Silver tables. The entire process kicks off with a simple report, [zetlre_bronze_to_silver](/Src/Programs/zetlre_bronze_to_silver.abap). While not explicitly built here, the **Gold layer** is envisioned as a layer on top of Silver, providing refined data for advanced analytics or Fiori applications.

## üèóÔ∏è Unpacking the Architecture: How it All Comes Together
This template offers a clear, modular structure for your ETL pipeline.

### üì• Bronze Layer Loading: Your Data's Entry Point
Once data is in Bronze, how do we get it out for the next stage? That's where our "bronze_lector" classes come in! They implement the [zetlif_bronze_lector](Src/Interfaces/zetlif_broze_lector.abap) interface, whose primary role is to provide a standardized way to inject dependencies for data selection. These specialized classes are solely responsible for reading data from a CDS view that directly queries your Bronze source. It's a clean, efficient way to access your raw data when you need it.

### ‚ú® Silver Processors: The Transformation Powerhouses
Meet the core of our transformation! The [zetlcl_to_silver_xyz](Src/Classes/zetlcl_to_silver_xyz1.abap) classes are the workhorses that implement the [zetlif_process_data](Src/Interfaces/zetlif_process_data.abap) interface. Each "to_silver" class is designed to handle a specific data flow, acting as a dedicated processor. They take data from their respective Bronze Lectors, apply the necessary transformations, and then persist the refined data into the Silver layer tables. This modular approach ensures clarity and maintainability for each transformation step.

### üßô Orchestrator: The ETL Conductor
At the heart of the Bronze-to-Silver ETL flow is the [zetlcl_to_silver_orchestrator](Src/Classes/zetlcl_to_silver_orchestrator.abap). This master class is responsible for overseeing and coordinating the execution of all the to_silver transformation classes. It's the conductor of your ETL symphony, ensuring each data flow is processed in the correct sequence.

### üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è The Report: Your One-Click ETL Trigger
Finally, we have a straightforward report, [zetlre_bronze_to_silver](/Src/Programs/zetlre_bronze_to_silver.abap), whose sole purpose is to kick off the entire Bronze-to-Silver ETL process. It simply calls the run_tagging_process method of the orchestrator, setting the entire data refinement journey into motion.
```abap
DATA: lo_orchestrator TYPE REF TO zetlcl_to_silver_orchestrator.
CREATE OBJECT lo_orchestrator.

lo_orchestrator->run_tagging_process( ).
```
